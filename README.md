# Sudoku Solver

Welcome to the **Sudoku Solver** project! This Haskell-based application is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently and serves as a demonstration of my functional programming skills, problem-solving approach, and attention to detail in developing logic-heavy algorithms.

## Overview

The Sudoku Solver takes a partially filled Sudoku grid, represented as a list of strings, and outputs the completed solution if possible. The solver uses logical techniques and backtracking to find the correct placement of numbers in the 9x9 grid while adhering to all Sudoku rules.

This project showcases my understanding of:
- Functional programming principles, especially in Haskell.
- The use of recursion, data handling, and list operations.
- Implementing algorithmic solutions in a clean, efficient manner.

## Features
- **Solves Partially Filled Puzzles**: The solver takes any Sudoku puzzle, identifies empty cells, and completes the grid according to Sudoku rules.
- **Functional Approach**: The solution is written in Haskell, highlighting functional programming paradigms such as immutability and recursion.
- **Stepwise Problem Solving**: The solver implements logical deduction techniques before using backtracking to find the solution, ensuring efficiency.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku Solver, clone the repository and run the Haskell file. You can modify the input grid within the code to test different puzzles.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sudoku-solver.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd sudoku-solver

# Run the Sudoku solver
runhaskell SudokuSolver.hs
```

## Project Structure
- `SudokuSolver.hs`: The main Haskell file that contains the logic to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
- `README.md`: This document, explaining the project and how to use it.

## Technologies Used
- **Haskell**: The entire application is written in Haskell, demonstrating my proficiency in functional programming and effective problem-solving in a purely functional language.

## Future Improvements
- **User Interface**: Add a simple CLI or graphical interface to make the solver more interactive.
- **Puzzle Generator**: Extend the application to generate Sudoku puzzles in addition to solving them.
